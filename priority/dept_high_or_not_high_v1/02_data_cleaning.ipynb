      "improve render system complete the item below i have updated the title without removing the emoji description currently velaptor has a class named rendererfactory the idea of this factory was to make it easy to create a renderer for the use of rendering whatever it is that you want to render it also currently only has a single method named createrenderer this single method creates an irenderer object the purpose of this is to allow a user to create the renderer which is a singleton and then use it to render whatever they want the problem is that the current implementation of irenderer which is an internal class is getting too large and difficult to maintain manage and test this can be greatly improved upon the idea is to create different irender types each one will be specialized for rendering different kinds of things for example one could be for rendering textures one for line primitives and another for text etc things to do create a new render texture overload to make it easier to render atlas sub textures create window size reactable event update window size throughout the codebase where it is required convert atlassubtexturedata to struct inside atlas data organize the subtexture data into groups by sub texture id this is going to be called inside of the texture renderer so it needs to be performant for iatlasdatagetframes create a new render texture overload that takes an iatlasdata for rendering create different types of render interfaces and associated implementations the idea is that the rendererfactory class can be used by a user to easily generate any of these renderer types as needed all of the current unit tests of course will need to be migrated to the correct implementations benefits more control is given to the user ability to only use what is required greatly cleans up the code base greatly improves testability reduces changes for bugs there are more rendering capabilities coming in the future and this will help create a better path to do so things to consider note all of the renderer implementations need to be internal sealed so the users do not have access note all of the renderer implementations need to go into the velaptorgraphics namespace note the ibatchservicemanager and batchservicemanager types might not be needed anymore this is because they will not all be required in a single place like it is currently set up in the renderer class each renderer can simply pull in the required batch manager that is required via di note the velaptor testing application scene management system needs to be updated this is going to eventually become a major feature in velaptor itself instead of a velaptor testing only feature the irenderer needs to be removed from the scene management system by removing the irenderer parameter from the render method and replaced with a frametime parameter list of render types itexturerenderer ifontrenderer irectanglerenderer ilinerenderer irenderer removed

in head commit a hreffound in base branch main vulnerability details netty is an opensource asynchronous eventdriven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high

validated by as it is propagated up this is fine as long as the request is not proxied through as if the request comes in as an stream gets converted into the domain objects httprequest httpcontent etc via and then sent up to the child channels pipeline and proxied through a remote peer as this may result in request smuggling in a proxy case users may assume the contentlength is validated somehow which is not the case if the request is forwarded to a backend channel that is a connection the contentlength now has meaning and needs to be checked an attacker can smuggle requests inside the body as it gets downgraded from to for an example attack refer to the linked github advisory users are only affected if all of this is true or is used is used to convert to objects and these objects are forwarded to another remote peer this has been patched in as a workaround the user can do the validation by themselves by implementing a custom channelinboundhandler that is put in the
