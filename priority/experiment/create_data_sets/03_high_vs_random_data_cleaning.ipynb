Android would go to sleep after X amount of time, putting the app into the background (I THINK, UNTESTED)\\r\\n- Use a package like https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-idle-monitor to track activity, have a schedule that is reset each time an event happens.\\r\\n- Use the above package but combine it with the current user authentication scheduler (tries to re-auth against the server every X minutes, or the local DB if no connection available) - I think not good\\r\\n\\r\\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\\r\\n\\r\\nNot having this in the dispensary/IC branch 🤣 \\r\\n\\r\\n## Additional context\\r\\n\\r\\n@wlthomson @mark-prins @Chris-Petty thoughts?\\r\\n\""
